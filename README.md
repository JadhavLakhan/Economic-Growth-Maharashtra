# Forecasting GSDP of Maharashtra State Using Time Series Analysis
This project focuses on forecasting the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Maharashtra using time series analysis techniques. By leveraging historical economic data, we apply various statistical and machine learning models to predict future economic trends.
# Key Features:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring GSDP data for analysis.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, seasonality, and patterns in economic growth.
 
Time Series Modeling: Implementing ARIMA,LSTM Neural Network.

Visualization & Insights: Interactive graphs and reports for better understanding of economic trends.

Python – Used for time series analysis, forecasting, and visualization. 
# The following Python libraries were utilized:
Pandas & NumPy – For data manipulation and pre-processing.

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For graphical representation of trends and patterns.

Statsmodels – For statistical analysis and ARIMA modelling.

TensorFlow & Keras – For building and training the LSTM deep learning model.

# Objectives
1.	To assess the contribution of the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors to gross state domestic product (GSDP) growth.
2.	To forecasting Maharashtra gross state domestic product (GSDP). 
3.	To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Maharashtra gross state domestic product (GSDP).
